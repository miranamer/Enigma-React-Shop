<h1>What Is This?</h1>
<p>This is a concept for a shop that I may make in the future. The functionality is limited as of yet, however I will continue to work on it and add actual items, not ones from other brands.</p>
<p>The timer on the home page indicates how long until the website closes. This is a feature that I thought would be interesting as it will increase demand for a given product if you only have a certain amount of time to buy it.</p>

<h1>Future Ideas</h1>
<ul>

  <li>Add Stripe Payment functionality</li>
  <li>Add mailing list functionality to email members notifying them of new drops</li>
  <li>Add a portfolio to show off products</li>
  <li>Create an FAQ page</li>

</ul>
